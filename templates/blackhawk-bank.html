          <h2>Key Research Findings</h2>
            <p>Valley Chevy is a conglomerate of Chevrolet dealerships located only in Arizona, so I wanted to make sure our organic content strategy mainly targeted local car shoppers. To achieve this, I conducted local keyword research to find out what Chevrolet keyword phrases have the highest search volume in Arizona. Here were some of my key findings:</p>
            <ul class="ul-bullets" style="line-height:1.2">
                <li>The Chevrolet search queries with the most search volume are vehicle comparisons, such as “Chevrolet Impala vs. Ford Fusion.”</li>
                <li>The majority of Chevrolet search queries relate to specific car features, such as “chevrolet camaro engine."</li>
                <li>Certain Chevrolet models have more search volume than others, such as the Silverado and Equinox.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>The SEO specialist helped me analyze how Valley Chevy currently ranked for these keywords in SERPs. Because the site featured no content relating to these popular keywords, Valley Chevy did not rank competitively for any of them.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0px">During my content audit, I also noticed ValleyChevy.com didn't have any helpful resources for local car owners, which revealed another major content gap and opportunity.</p>

            <h2>The Content Strategy</h2>
            <p>Once we were done with our analysis, I brainstormed and outlined the key steps of our content strategy:</p>
            <div style="padding-left:20px">
                <p><b>Step 1:</b> Create landing pages that help visitors compare each Chevrolet model to its main competitiors. Naturally incorporate longtail keywords and Locate Dealer CTAs throughout the pages.</p>
                <p><b>Step 2:</b> Create articles that target popular keywords about each Chevrolet car model to help Valley Chevy rank higher in Chevrolet-related SERPs. Naturally include links to the car model's landing pages.</p> 
                <p><b>Step 3:</b> Create articles that appeal to Arizona car owners and incorporate strategic keywords to increase local traffic and engagement. Incorporate links to any relevant landing pages.</p>
                <p><b>Step 4:</b> Create visual content (e.g. infographics, videos, quizzes) and share it on social media to increase local traffic and visitor engagement.</p>     
            </div>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0px">I also created a content calendar that outlines each piece of content I planned to create for the next month. I chose to focus on the Chevy Equinox first because this model 
            had the second highest search volume and the least amount of sales at Valley Chevy dealerships.</p>
